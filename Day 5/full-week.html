    <h1> My Goals </h1>
    <p>Goal one: I want to make beautiful web pages that will be great for marketing purposes. I also want to learn more
        about developing pages that have good user Inactivity.</p>
    <p> Goal two: To learn JavaScript and eventually move onto building a mobile app. I have an idea that may make my
        life easier at my full time job. This idea is top secret level and only one person shares the idea. That person
        orginally gave me the design and my goal is to make it a reality.</p>
